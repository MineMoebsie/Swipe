# Swipe

To play:
Install python and all of the requirements in requirements.txt (last time I checked it was only Pygame).

Swipe is a game in which you control a character that is a square and can only more in four directions. However, if you move in a chosen direction, you continue to do so until you either collide with a wall or you die (in blue spikes). The game difficulty increases with the levels. The first 10 and then every 5 levels have a different theme with different challenges. Such as enemies, including a ghost that chases you, a plant that shoots spikes or a whirl which grows to "eat" the map. There are 21 levels with the last one being the boss fight.

TIP: Save your bullets for the boss fight! You are going to need at least 6 bullets before starting level 21 (if you play perfectly).
